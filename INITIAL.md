[Insert your feature here]

## EXAMPLES:

An examples of configs, metas, and meta.yamls (meta-sanity) are available in the examples folder:
- `chase` directory provides clearer and cleaner examples
- `jason` directory provides more complicated and opaque but sophisticated uses of LAP.
- `starters` are examples that you should try to follow as they correspond to the opionated development workflow of this template LAP repo.

## DOCUMENTATION:

### LAP Documentation
All documentation for builing lap pipelines are available in the `docs` directory.

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
- Your main development should take place in the `config` and `src` directories.
- Users will generally put files that will need to be linked in their pipelines in the `raw`
- NEVER change files in the `out` or `log` directories as these are controlled directly by LAP!
